## Paddle NW
Paddle NW was designed for people who love to be on the water (whether it's kayaking or paddle boarding) and want an app that will show them the best places around for doing just that. You can like a location to save for later or upload pictures of your adventure for others to see. Switch between list view for photos, and map view to see the places closest to you.
